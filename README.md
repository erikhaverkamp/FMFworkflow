# FMFworkflow

The Full-Metadata Format (FMF) is described in http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1299. This repository contains the description and implementation of an addition to the python API for the FMF.

The orginal library is written in python and can be found here: https://github.com/SGWissInfo/pyfmflib

It is a dotnet core library to read/write FMF files for both measurement results and measurement procedures.

Focus is on the definition of an open protocol for workflow description to enable measurements in scientific environments
